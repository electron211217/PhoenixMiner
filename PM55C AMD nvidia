Want to check integrity of the files available to download from https://phoenixminer.org/#check. mostly the PM55C amd+nvidia version dont look legit as it sha 1 IS 019067efb0e01484b3b42d5777395e0e6f413faf
AND IT DONT MATCH WITH ANY EXAMPLE OF CHECKSUM .
So this is is  a compromised version... i installed and let run for few week... constating that my home network was getting slowed and is still...
what are risk for my financials ? should i wipe every device, android like windo that was connected on wifi? 
Please could you give help?
